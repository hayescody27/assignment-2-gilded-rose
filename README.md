### Collaboration tool

For remote collaboration we used a combination of two tools. 
First, we used Teams as our means of communication. 
Teams allowed us to communicate verbally, share screens, and send messages. 
The next tool we used was the Intellij IDE Premium Edition, which offers a tool called "Code With Me".
The Code With Me tool allows for real time collaboration between developers.
While using Code With Me all group members could see what file each other member was in, where their cursor was, and see any edits made as they made them.
This allowed us to provide instant feedback for each other.
